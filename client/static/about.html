                    To enter a dungeon, there must be a max of 4 characters in the party. If the user cannot find actual people to pair up with, they can spend money to higher mercanaries to tag along. The Merc system has 2 steps to it, advertisment and hiring. Both cost seperatly. The more money invested into advertisment, the more stronger the option of npc. The Mercs are scaled towards the adventure rank of the player. Stronger Mercs have their stats more optimized towards thier class while weaker ones, although at the same level, will be missing some skills as well as bad equipments. Players are free to provid equipments but if they party fails to leave safely, the equipment would be loss. In the event where the players are not able to hire the mercs, the guild would always offer free npcs to join but they would be a few levels under as well as having only basic equipments.
