		<p style="color: white;">
			Mytichal Magic Weilders of Nerrowind. The study of the magic arts had been a common stable in Nerrowind history for centuries.
			But now withtmany childern aspiring to be strong warriors, the art of magic has been practieced less and less. This is due to how difficult it is with weilding magic.
			As someone once said, "Why spend years to learn a magic to break bones when I can just do it with my bare hands." None the less, magic user are claimed to be one of the most powerful beings in Nerrowind.
			When in battle, mages can destory large areas or condense their attack on a single target. However, even with their high damgage output, they aren't known to be able to endure much hits. Said to be every fragile.
			When it comes to magic, they know it all. From the standard magic attacks like fire, earth, wind, water, electric, and ice to the more speicalized magic light and dark.
			Mages can learn a wide varity of magic from straight up dealing damage to healing allies. Although support isn't their specaitly, they can weaken enemis with the speicalized dark magic.
			To play a mage, casting takes turns to land. A mage player will need to find ways to not die before their spells takes effect. Mages are not effcient at the start of battle
			but once thier magic finally cast, it will be a chain of destruction on after another.</p>

			Rouges had taken a honorable role throughout the history of Nerrowind, as they do all the dirty deeds of the country, assassinations. Swift and quick, rouges attacks are often fatal, leaving the enemy dead before they even notice.
			There are stories of how there is this 1 rouge silenced and entire camp full of soldiers in 1 night. Their attack sometimes even rivals that of warriors. With their speed and thier tools, they have the luxary to play around before landing their final blow.

		<h2 style="color: white;">Warrior</h2>
		<p style="color: white;">
		The strongest adventures in all of Nerrowind. When it comes to might and endurence, the warriors tops it off. Warriors are known for thier honor, strength, and nobility.
		Some of the most powerful Kings of Nerrowind are warriors. They themselves are the embodiment of hope, as they never fall down and will always be the first ones marching into battle.
		However, even with all the glory of being a warrior, they are very high maintence. Without money, warriors wouldn't be able to afford the things that allows them to be in the front lines. Hince why most warriors hail from nobility.
		Heavy armor is expensive, as well as the heavy weapons they use to be able to output the damage they are known for. However, its easy to be a warrior. Anyone can just pick up a sword and swing.
		Yet, to be a warrior that leads the battle takes more than a swing of a sword. When battle, there are two options a warrior have, either tank the blows for the team or wait for your turn to do that big damage. However, these are Nerrowind warriors,
		they don't play by the rules. "Who said a warrios it slow? I will wring thier necks and use them as my sword!". Warriors are often the last one to attack, yet they don't just have to stand their and wait.
		With counter ability, if the warrior knows they are going to get hit, they wait and anticapte the attack, dealing massive damage while avoiding the attack. They are however weak to magic but not defeneless. In Nerrowind, an experineced warrior can cut down magic,
		totally avoiding the attack. Being the tank they are known for, warriors often comes with built in regeneration. With a decent armor, warriors will always be the last to fall in battle.

		<h2 style="color: white;">Bard</h2>
		<p style="color: white;">
		The loving, often drunk bards of Nerrowind. They are self proclaimed "Musical Prodigies" and have even opened thier own Musical University.
		People often find it weird that bards are on the battlefield. "Why is someone that plays music doing in a place full of iron and blood?" 
		Typically bards are supports of the world. With their instruments, they can boost the morales of thier allies, making them stronger in battle. Along boosting allies, they can deteriorate enemies, making them
		harder to fight back as the warriors march in. But lets not forget, Nerrowind bards are different. Along with thier stadard roles as support, when a bard fights back, it will end more than just a ruptured ear drums.
		Being the masters of sound, their attacks can go through many defenses and deal damage striaght to the body. With some knowledge in magic, they can enchant their music with the elements, causing all kinds of interal damage.
		From healer to dealer, they have it all. Bards have the potential to become the strongest. Not everyone can speicalized in everything but a bard can. The stories of pass heros, their adventures, thier experinece,
		a bard memorizes it all. Even through they are known as a loving drunk, they themselves carry the entire history of Nerrowind.
