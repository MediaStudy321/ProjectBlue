    <h1>Dicecapades</h1>
  <p> Welcome fellow traveler! The Kingdom of Nerrowind was once a vast land of brilliant scholars, and noble warriors alike. Our civilization thrives off of the power of the Eternal Stone. This stone grants access to unimaginable power, and in the wrong hands could perish an entire Kingdom with the bat of an eye. Our guardians kept this stone secured deep in the vault of the catacombs. The stone was used to keep our crops fertile, and to produce resources needed to advance our Kingdom to unimaginable heights. That is until the day Lord Superius and his army invaded the Kingdom of Nerrowind. They burned our homes, schools, and shops to the ground until there was nothing left but a mountain of ash. Despite the efforts of our fiercest warriors, The Dark Lord escaped with the Eternal Stone, and swore to conquer the entire world. With all of our best Warriors either dead or wounded, it is up to you to find Lord Imperius in the depths of his dark, twisted underground lairs and to retrieve the stone before it is too late! </p>
